# CNN-and-Data-Augmentation-for-Image-Classification


# The following problem statement is taken from kaggle website named as Cats v/s Dogs image classification
# Step1: For data preprocessing we first read the picture files 
# Step2: Then we convert the JPEG images into RBG images 
# Step3: We then convert it into appropriate tensors and then into pixels betn 0-1 (by scaling it down with a factor of 255)
# We implement the method of Data augmentation to populate the model with more variations of the image and thereby increase the accuracy and lower the loss
# Also incorporated the VGG16 transfer learning method to increase accuracy above 95%
